# Dear ImGui wrapper for the Beef Programming Language 

![Generation](https://github.com/RogueMacro/imgui-beef/workflows/Generation/badge.svg)

Note: SDL binaries are not automatically generated yet. Feel free to send me a message on discord (RogueMacro#8595) if you want it to be added soon. It is not my top priority at the moment.

## Generation

Generation happens at 06:00 UTC every day

The generator uses the docking_inter branch of https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui. I have not made any other branches, so docking and viewports can be enabled on demand. It it however, not by default.
