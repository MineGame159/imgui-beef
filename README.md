# Dear ImGui wrapper for the Beef Programming Language 

![Generation](https://github.com/RogueMacro/imgui-beef/workflows/Generation/badge.svg)

Note: SDL binaries are not automatically generated yet

## Generation

Generation happens at 06:00 UTC every day

The generator uses the docking_inter branch of https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui. I have not made any other branches, so docking and viewports can be enabled on demand. It is however, not by default.

## Usage

Clone the project into BeefLibs, then in the IDE, right click your workspace and go Add From Installed > ImGui, ImGuiImpl...your impl...
You can also clone it to any other directory then go Add existing project > /path/to/ImGui
